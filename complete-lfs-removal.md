# Complete LFS Removal - Files Still Tracked

## Problem
LFS is still trying to upload files because they were previously tracked. We need to completely remove LFS tracking.

## Complete LFS Removal Commands:

```bash
# Stop the current LFS upload (Ctrl+C if still running)

# Remove LFS completely
git lfs uninstall

# Remove all LFS tracking
git lfs untrack "*"

# Remove .gitattributes if it exists
rm -f .gitattributes

# Remove all files from Git cache
git rm --cached -r .

# Add all files back normally (without LFS)
git add .

# Commit the changes
git commit -m "Completely remove LFS - use regular Git"

# Push to GitHub (should be fast now)
git push origin main
```

## Alternative: Force Push (if above doesn't work)
```bash
# If still having issues, force push without LFS
git push --force-with-lease origin main
```

## Why This Happens:
- Files were previously tracked by LFS
- Git still thinks they're LFS files
- Need to completely untrack and re-add them
