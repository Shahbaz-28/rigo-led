# üö® Vercel Image Display Fix

## Problem
Images work locally but not on Vercel deployment due to large file sizes.

## Quick Fix Steps:

### Step 1: Optimize Images (CRITICAL)
Your images are too large for Vercel:
- G 2.png: 11MB ‚ùå
- G 3.png: 8.6MB ‚ùå
- D 3.png: 7.9MB ‚ùå

**Action Required:**
1. Go to https://tinypng.com/
2. Upload your large images
3. Download optimized versions (should be under 500KB each)
4. Replace files in `frontend/public/images/`

### Step 2: Alternative - Use External Image Hosting
If you want to keep large images:

1. **Upload to Cloudinary/ImgBB:**
   - Go to https://cloudinary.com/ or https://imgbb.com/
   - Upload your large images
   - Get public URLs

2. **Update Image Paths:**
   ```javascript
   // Instead of: /images/G 2.png
   // Use: https://res.cloudinary.com/your-account/image/upload/v1/G%202.png
   ```

### Step 3: Check Vercel Build Logs
1. Go to your Vercel dashboard
2. Check the latest deployment
3. Look for any errors in the build logs
4. Check if images are being uploaded

### Step 4: Redeploy
After optimizing images:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Optimize images for Vercel"
git push
# Vercel will auto-deploy
```

## Expected Results:
- Images under 500KB each
- Images display properly on Vercel
- Faster loading times
- Better user experience
